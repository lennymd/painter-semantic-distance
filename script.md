## Introduction

The fourth day of this class will show you:

- [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/), a platform for finding and working with different machine learning models.
- How to use **DistilBERT** to visualize how similar painters are based on their short bios.

Please download the code and data from the [github repository](https://github.com/aica-wavelab/aica-assignments) and follow the instructions in the `A4_painter_semantic_distance`.
